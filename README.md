Hello, I offer a solution to the task in three versions (containing additional points of the task)
In solutions v2 and v3, the dynamic link library is located in the "lib" folder. 
The "curves" folder contains the project files for compiling the dynamic link library
When starting the application, you need to copy the lib/curves.dll file to the folder with the application executable file. All source files were compiled using Visual C++.
Initially, a version with a graphics module using OpenGL was intended, since I wanted to do a little more than was required, which is why elements of linear algebra remained in the source code, but I didnâ€™t have time (I was dealing with new material)
